            Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence,
            such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. It's a broad field focused on creating systems that can perceive their environment, process information, and act to achieve specific goals, often adapting their behavior based on past actions and data. AI is increasingly integrated into various aspects of daily life, 
            from personalized recommendations to advanced medical breakthroughs.

            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. 
            It allows web developers to separate content from design, enabling them to control layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual appearance of web pages. 
            By using CSS, developers can create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices, enhancing user experience across platforms.
